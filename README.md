# Kicks - Shoes E-Commerce Application  
In this project, I designed a modern **sneaker e-commerce platform**.  
The platform allows users to view and explore products, while admins can manage product details easily.  

âœ¨ Tech Stack:  
- **React 19** â€“ latest version of React  
- **React Router DOM** â€“ for page navigation  
- **TanStack Query** â€“ for data fetching and state management  
- **Axios** â€“ for API requests  
- **TailwindCSS** â€“ for responsive UI design  

ðŸ›  Features:  
- **Admin Panel** to add, edit, and delete products  
- **Discount Management**: assign discount percentages to products  
- **Product Listing**: display products on the homepage and recommendations  
- **Product Detail Page**: view product information, colors, and sizes  
- **Responsive Design**: compatible with mobile, tablet, and desktop  

With this project, I focused on building the **UI and management side of an e-commerce system**, improving my **front-end development skills** and design capabilities.
