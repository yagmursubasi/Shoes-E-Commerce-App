# Kicks - Sneaker E-Commerce Application  
In this project, I developed a modern **sneaker e-commerce platform** designed to deliver a seamless experience for both users and admins. The goal was to create an environment where users can easily browse, filter, and purchase sneakers, while admins can efficiently manage products.  

âœ¨ Tech Stack:  
- **React 19** â€“ built with the latest React version  
- **React Router DOM** â€“ for page routing and navigation  
- **TanStack Query** â€“ for powerful data fetching and caching  
- **Axios** â€“ to simplify API requests  
- **TailwindCSS** â€“ for a modern, responsive UI  

ðŸ›  Features:  
- **Admin Panel** for adding, editing, and deleting products  
- **Discount Management**: ability to set discounts for specific products  
- **Dynamic User Experience**: browse, filter, and view product details  
- **Purchase Flow**: add products to cart and proceed with checkout  
- **Responsive Design**: works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- **Modern UI/UX**: clean, fast, and user-friendly  

This project helped me simulate the core flow of a real e-commerce system while strengthening my **front-end development skills**, **state management expertise**, and **user experience design capabilities**.
